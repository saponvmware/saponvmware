With the vSphere 6.7 Update 2 release VMware increased the number of virtual CPUs from 128 up to 256. With the change about the configuration maximums, now is possible to create larger virtual machines for SAP HANA with higher demand of virtual CPUs. To create virtual machine with more than 128 virtual CPUs virtual hardware version 15 is required.

This enables SAP HANA deployment beyond the 192 virtual CPU limited, but still with the limitation about the configuration maximum of 6 TB memory per virtual machine in a Scale-Up deployment. Due the restriction of the underlaying certified hardware SAP limited the support of the different Intel CPU types regarding the usage of the number of virtual CPUs. 144 vCPUs with Haswell CPUs, 192 vCPUs with Broadwell and 224 vCPUs with Skylake and Cascade Lake CPUs.

With the introduction of Tailored Data Center Phase 5 (TDIv5) SAP started to deviate from the previous “core-to-memory” ratio. With introducing the “workload-based sizing” SAP extends the support for virtualized deployment with deviate from existing “core-to-memory” ratio. The support is granted with certified SAP HANA hardware, validated hypervisor and deviations with the limits (upper and lower) of the hypervisor.

With the “workload-based sizing” SAP differentness between three different deployment types OLTP, OLAP and mixed OLTP and OLAP workload like S/4. Therefore, SAP offers for the different deployment types ABAP on HANA sizing reports for the estimated sizing.

*Conclusion:* With the “workload-base sizing” the memory limitations can be mitigated.
