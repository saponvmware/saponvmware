The reason why I started and running this blog is that as a Subject Matter Experts (SME) I often get asked about the virtualization of SAP Systems and SAP HANA databases on VMware vSphere.

With this blog I want to answer the most important and often raised questions in a way that a non-expert for SAP (HANA) on VMware could consume the content in an understandable and comprehensible way. I will be trying to publish new articles more or less on a regular base.
